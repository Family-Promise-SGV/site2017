# site2017
Welcome!

These are the theme and plugin files for Family Promise of the San Gabriel Valley at familypromisesgv.org, 
launching at the very end of 2016 and growing in 2017.

It's a time to celebrate a new season!

And in the spirit of community, we make these files public so that if you see things that need fixing, or you have an idea you'd like to see on the site, you have a way to participate!

We look forward to your contributions, your pull requests and, yes, your issues, too, as we all work together to make sure that in the SGV,

EVERY CHILD HAS A HOME.

Wishing you a safe and happy holiday season and a healthy, sweet and prosperous 2017,

The Family Promise SVG development team
